# Usage guide

This is the official guide for building Django/React applications using Django Render. It is designed to serve as both a starting point and a reference guide.

**WORK IN PROGRESS: This documentation is currently being worked on and should greatly improve over the summer**

## Getting started

Have a look at our [demo project](https://demo.django-render.org/) to get an idea of how Django Render works.

The [source code](https://github.com/kaedroho/djangopress) is permissively licenced so feel free to copy that project to get started.
