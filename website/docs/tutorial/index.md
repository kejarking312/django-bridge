# Tutorial

Welcome to Django Render!

This section of the documentation is aimed at newcomers to Django Render.

We will start a new project and build a TODO list application using Django for the backend and React for the frontend.

## Prerequisites

Node.js - We will be using an `npm-start` template to start a new project
Docker or Python - The template includes docker-compose configuration, but you can also use Python directly
